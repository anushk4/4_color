# Four Color Theorem

The python code uses the Breadth First Search algorithm twice to find out the color of the marginal points and all the points within a single node and colors it according to the Four Color Theorem which says `given any separation of the plane into contiguous regions, called a "map," the regions can be colored using at most four colors so that no two adjacent regions have the same color`

## Requirements
- Python IDLE
- Code editor
- Matplotlib library
- Tkinter library

## Running the code
- Run the python code using the `run` button or `F5`
- A prompt will be generated. Enter the file name which contains the test case for the graph
- Click on `Generate Graph` button to generate the graph.

## Important notes for running
- The test case file should be included within the `test_cases` directory only for it to be read successfully by the application.
- Each node is represented by a cluster of numbers. Refer to sample test cases in the `test_cases` directory to generate your own test case.
- The test case should be in a rectangular or square form only.
